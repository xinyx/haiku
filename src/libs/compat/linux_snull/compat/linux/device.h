 * struct bus_type - The bus type of the device

 * @dev_attrs:	Default attributes of the devices on the bus.
 * @bus_groups:	Default attributes of the bus.
 * @dev_groups:	Default attributes of the devices on the bus.
 * @drv_groups: Default attributes of the device drivers on the bus.
 * @match:	Called, perhaps multiple times, whenever a new device or driver
 *		is added for this bus. It should return a nonzero value if the
 *		given device can be handled by the given driver.
 * @uevent:	Called when a device is added, removed, or a few other things
 *		that generate uevents to add the environment variables.
 * @probe:	Called when a new device or driver add to this bus, and callback
 *		the specific driver's probe to initial the matched device.
 * @remove:	Called when a device removed from this bus.
 * @shutdown:	Called at shut-down time to quiesce the device.
 *
 * @online:	Called to put the device back online (after offlining it).
 * @offline:	Called to put the device offline for hot-removal. May fail.
 *
 * @suspend:	Called when a device on this bus wants to go to sleep mode.
 * @resume:	Called to bring a device on this bus out of sleep mode.
 * @pm:		Power management operations of this bus, callback the specific
 *		device driver's pm-ops.
 * @iommu_ops:  IOMMU specific operations for this bus, used to attach IOMMU
 *              driver implementations to a bus and allow the driver to do
 *              bus-specific setup
 * @p:		The private data of the driver core, only the driver core can
 *		touch this.
 * @lock_key:	Lock class key for use by the lock validator
 *
 * A bus is a channel between the processor and one or more devices. For the
 * purposes of the device model, all devices are connected via a bus, even if
 * it is an internal, virtual, "platform" bus. Buses can plug into each other.
 * A USB controller is usually a PCI device, for example. The device model
 * represents the actual connections between buses and the devices they control.
 * A bus is represented by the bus_type structure. It contains the name, the
 * default attributes, the bus' methods, PM operations, and the driver core's
 * private data.

/**
 * struct device - The basic device structure
 * @parent:	The device's "parent" device, the device to which it is attached.
 * 		In most cases, a parent device is some sort of bus or host
 * 		controller. If parent is NULL, the device, is a top-level device,
 * 		which is not usually what you want.
 * @p:		Holds the private data of the driver core portions of the device.
 * 		See the comment of the struct device_private for detail.
 * @kobj:	A top-level, abstract class from which other classes are derived.
 * @init_name:	Initial name of the device.
 * @type:	The type of device.
 * 		This identifies the device type and carries type-specific
 * 		information.
 * @mutex:	Mutex to synchronize calls to its driver.
 * @bus:	Type of bus device is on.
 * @driver:	Which driver has allocated this
 * @platform_data: Platform data specific to the device.
 * 		Example: For devices on custom boards, as typical of embedded
 * 		and SOC based hardware, Linux often uses platform_data to point
 * 		to board-specific structures describing devices and how they
 * 		are wired.  That can include what ports are available, chip
 * 		variants, which GPIO pins act in what additional roles, and so
 * 		on.  This shrinks the "Board Support Packages" (BSPs) and
 * 		minimizes board-specific #ifdefs in drivers.
 * @driver_data: Private pointer for driver specific info.
 * @power:	For device power management.
 * 		See Documentation/power/devices.txt for details.
 * @pm_domain:	Provide callbacks that are executed during system suspend,
 * 		hibernation, system resume and during runtime PM transitions
 * 		along with subsystem-level and driver-level callbacks.
 * @pins:	For device pin management.
 *		See Documentation/pinctrl.txt for details.
 * @numa_node:	NUMA node this device is close to.
 * @dma_mask:	Dma mask (if dma'ble device).
 * @coherent_dma_mask: Like dma_mask, but for alloc_coherent mapping as not all
 * 		hardware supports 64-bit addresses for consistent allocations
 * 		such descriptors.
 * @dma_pfn_offset: offset of DMA memory range relatively of RAM
 * @dma_parms:	A low level driver may set these to teach IOMMU code about
 * 		segment limitations.
 * @dma_pools:	Dma pools (if dma'ble device).
 * @dma_mem:	Internal for coherent mem override.
 * @cma_area:	Contiguous memory area for dma allocations
 * @archdata:	For arch-specific additions.
 * @of_node:	Associated device tree node.
 * @acpi_node:	Associated ACPI device node.
 * @devt:	For creating the sysfs "dev".
 * @id:		device instance
 * @devres_lock: Spinlock to protect the resource of the device.
 * @devres_head: The resources list of the device.
 * @knode_class: The node used to add the device to the class list.
 * @class:	The class of the device.
 * @groups:	Optional attribute groups.
 * @release:	Callback to free the device after all references have
 * 		gone away. This should be set by the allocator of the
 * 		device (i.e. the bus driver that discovered the device).
 * @iommu_group: IOMMU group the device belongs to.
 *
 * @offline_disabled: If set, the device is permanently online.
 * @offline:	Set after successful invocation of bus type's .offline().
 *
 * At the lowest level, every device in a Linux system is represented by an
 * instance of struct device. The device structure contains the information
 * that the device model core needs to model the system. Most subsystems,
 * however, track additional information about the devices they host. As a
 * result, it is rare for devices to be represented by bare device structures;
 * instead, that structure, like kobject structures, is usually embedded within
 * a higher-level representation of the device.
